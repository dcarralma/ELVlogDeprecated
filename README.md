# Velox
This repository contains an Eclipse project implementing the very efficient ELV (i.e., OWL EL plus nominal schemas) reasoner Velox.
The project uses native libraries which will only work on Mac OS (namely, the JRDFOx.jar library).
If you are interested in using Velox with some other operating system send me an email to dcarralma@gmail.com, I'd love to help you out!
