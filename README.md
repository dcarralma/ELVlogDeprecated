# Velox
This repository contains an Eclipse project with the implementation of the ELVn reasoner Velox (ELVn is a Description Logic fragment that extends the epxressivity of OWL 2 EL allowing for the use of nominal schemas).
At the moment, this project uses native libraries which will only work on Mac OS (namely, the JRDFOx.jar library).
Nevertheles, if you are interested in using Velox with some other operating system send me an email to dcarralma@gmail.com, I'd love to help you out!
